### Q39

You are asked to develop a program for a shopping application, and you are given the following information:

* The application must contain the classes Toy, EduToy, and ConsToy. The Toy class is the superclass of the other two classes.  

* The int calculatePrice (Toy t) method calculates the price of a toy.  

* The void printToy (Toy t) method prints the details of a toy.  

Which definition of the Toy class adds a valid layer of abstraction to the class hierarchy?
